    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step by Step</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to the dry ingredients. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Carefully stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin, but this ensures a moist cake.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Frost and decorate as desired. Enjoy your delicious chocolate cake!</li>
    </ol>
